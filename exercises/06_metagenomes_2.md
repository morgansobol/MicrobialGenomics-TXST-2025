# Week 5: Genome-centric metagenomics

In this tutorial, we will be using a different part of the Infant Gut Dataset

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:
- Understand the difference between a genome and a metagenome.
- Assess differential coverage and detection of genes across metagenomes. 
- Compare genes across metagenome samples.
- Assesses differences in SNVs across genes.

## ðŸ§ª Step 1: Reading in the data and setting up the working environment
