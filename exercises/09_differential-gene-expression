# Week 9: Differential Expression Analysis

Studies of **differential expression** generally aim to determine the differences between a **baseline condition** and an **experimental condition**.
In the simplest case, expression levels are compared between two conditionsâ€”for example, **control vs. treatment** or **mutant vs. wildâ€‘type**. 
More complex experiments may include additional experimental factors, such as **multiple mutants** or **different doses of a drug**.

In this tutorial, you will compare RNAâ€‘Seq data obtained from different conditions in order to detect genes that are expressed with statistically significant differences. 

We will be working in R this time.

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:
* Explain how single-copy core genes are identified and used in phylogenomics.
* Interpret phylogenetic trees in the context of evolutionary relationships.
* Recognize limitations and sources of bias in genome-based phylogenetic inference.


## ðŸ§ª Step 1: Reading in the data and setting up the working environment
Like the last few weeks, you need to make a new `week9` directory inside your `microgenomics-2025` directory. 
Make a `work_dir` inside `week9`. Then, from Canvas Module 9, download the data_dir.zip file and use `unzip` to unzip the directory. 
Print your `week9` path using `pwd`. 

Now open up R Studio. To set your path in R:
```R
setwd("copy/path/from/pwd")
```
Use the command `getwd()` to verify that `setwd()` worked.
